# highcontrast-lemonblush

## Overview
This project was created because, although there are several high contrast themes for VS Code, none fully matched my personal taste or visual comfort. Some had details in their color usage that didn't convince me, so I decided to make my own variants: one yellow and one pink. The focus is more on personal aesthetic and comfort than on universal visibility or experience.
